# edge_detection_and_3d_projection

the system is designed to interface with usb cameras with a measured fov

By running edge detection on the caught immages and attempting to match angle values between pixels, a 3d projection 
is rendered with a distance matched to the distance of the caught object

Additional ideas for improvement
-size matching of shapes
-means squared and similar loss functions from a point of reference
-fitting best fit equations to edges and matching these instead
-designed a neural network that takes the two images as input and renders the output
